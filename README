                             drte - dr's text editor
drte is a simple text editor. It's currently in early stages of development.

Current limitations:

  - UTF8 support is very basic
  - resizing the terminal window leads to problems
  - currently only unix line endings (\n) are recognized
  - it needs a better name

Compiling:

  drte needs ncurses. A C compiler and make are also necessary.

  View/Edit Makefile. make. There is no install script, yet.

Usage:

  drte [file, file_2, ... file_n]
